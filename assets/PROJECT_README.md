- Clean serif or sans-serif for body text (e.g., Open Sans, Lato)
- Clear hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 > Body

### Color Palette:
- Earthy, natural tones that evoke cabin living

  - Secondary: Forest greens (#2C5F2D, #97BC62)
  - Neutral: Creams and off-whites (#F5F5DC, #FAFAF8)
  - Accent: Rust or deep orange (#C1502E)
- Use client's cabin photos as inspiration for final color choices

### Layout Principles:
- Maximum content width: 1200-1400px for readability
- Generous padding and margins (minimum 20px, preferably 40-60px)
- Sections should breathe with white space
- Mobile-first responsive thinking (even if not fully functional)

### Images:
- Use placeholder images initially (or indicate where client photos will go)
- Recommended image placeholders: https://placeholder.com or similar
- Image dimensions should be noted in comments
- Suggest image sizes for different sections

## Content Guidelines

### Tone & Voice:
- Warm, welcoming, and aspirational
- Focus on experience and escape
- Professional but not overly formal
- Use evocative language (e.g., "Your Mountain Retreat Awaits")

### Placeholder Content:
- Use realistic placeholder text (not Lorem Ipsum)
- Create believable cabin names (e.g., "The Pinewood Retreat", "Lakeside Haven")
- Write sample descriptions that reflect actual cabin selling points
- Include realistic pricing (e.g., "$250/night" or "Starting at $180,000")

## Special Instructions for Claude

1. **Image Placeholders**: Since I will provide actual cabin photos later, please use high-quality placeholder images or clearly mark where images should be inserted with descriptive comments.

2. **Comments in Code**: Please add helpful comments in the HTML and CSS indicating:
   - Where to insert specific cabin photos
   - Recommended image dimensions
   - Sections that should be customized with client-specific content

3. **Responsiveness Notes**: While this is primarily a desktop mockup, please include CSS media query structure (even if not fully built out) to show responsive design thinking.

4. **Professional Quality**: This will be shown to a paying client, so please ensure:
   - Clean, well-organized code
   - Consistent spacing and alignment
   - Professional design that competes with the reference websites
   - Attention to typography and visual hierarchy

5. **E-Commerce Elements**: Include visual elements that suggest e-commerce functionality:
   - "Add to Cart" or "Book Now" buttons
   - Price displays
   - Availability indicators
   - "Favorites" or wishlist icons

6. **Customization Ready**: Make it easy for me to:
   - Swap in real cabin photos
   - Update text content
   - Adjust colors by using CSS variables
   - Add more cabin listings

## Deliverables

Please provide:
1. **index.html** - Complete HTML structure with semantic markup
2. **styles.css** - All CSS styling with organized sections and comments
3. **Brief README or comments** explaining:
   - How to customize colors (CSS variables location)
   - Where to insert client cabin photos
   - Any special notes about the design choices

## Questions to Consider

Before you begin, Claude, please review and consider:
- Should this be a single long-scrolling page or multiple pages?
- What cabin details are most important to highlight?
- How many cabin listings should appear in the showcase section?

Feel free to make design decisions that serve the goal of creating an impressive, professional mockup for client presentation.
